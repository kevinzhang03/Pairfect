for this hackathon, we are thinking of developing an app that: collects data from a comprehensive questioeir nnaire about a user's lfiestyle, love preferences, etc like a data app profile thing. but, the interesting thing is that they may also put in the names of their previous relationships or the names of ex's, their relationships, reason for breakup, etc. then, when their ex happens to join the platform, the system is able to collect their data as well and create the association that this new user is the ex of the other user. as more people join, we get their data and we can create a detailed relationship graph. and then we can do an ml training thing to develop a model to predict whether two new users may be compatible or not.
